Review the Information: Familiarize yourself with the given video subtitles. Each subtitle will be presented in the format:

[{"text": "subtitle text", "start": specific time, "duration": specific duration}, {...}, ...]

Think and Analyze: Before jumping to conclusions, take a moment to think about the possible visual events that might correspond to each subtitle.

Extract Visual Events: For each subtitle, determine the visually observable events. Remember, these events should be purely visual, without any influence from the audio or spoken content.

Describe the Events: Use your own words to describe each event. Be as detailed and clear as possible.

Format Your Findings: List down the events in the following structured format:

Visual Event 1: It's shown in the video that... Start time: ... End Time: ...
Visual Event 2: It's shown in the video that... Start time: ... End Time: ...
Continue this format for all the visual events you identify.

Finalize: Once you've listed all the events, review your work to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Now, with the instructions clear, you will be given the subtitles and let's dive into the actual given information and begin the analysis.
